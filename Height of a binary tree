The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
A root node will have a depth of 0.

The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
A leaf node will have a height of 0


Here in question height is defined as number of nodes from root to leaf nodes

// return -the Height of the given Binary Tree
int helper(Node*root)
{
    if(root==NULL) return -1;
    return max(helper(root->left),helper(root->right))+1;
}
int height(Node* root)
{
   // Your code here
   //without +1 it will calculate number of edges
   return helper(root)+1; //height-> number of nodes from node to leaf
}
